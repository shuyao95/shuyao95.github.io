<p>
Currently, my research interest includes but is not restricted to the following aspects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning:
<ul>
  <li>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), e.g., Automated Data Optimization, Neural Architecture Search, Hyper-parameter Optimization.</li>
  <li>Deep Learning theory, e.g., Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), Statistical Learning Theory.</li>
  <li>Optimization algorithms, e.g., zeroth-order optimization algorithms, hybrid optimization algorithms.</li>
  <li>Decision under uncertainty, e.g., Bayesian Optimization (BO), bandit algorithms.</li>
  <li>Data-Centric AI, e.g., data valuation, data ownership, automated data optimization.</li>
</ul>
