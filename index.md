## About Me
I am currently a researcher at the Guangdong Lab of AI and Digital Economy (SZ), focusing on pioneering advancements in principled artificial intelligence research. Previously, I was a senior researcher at Tencent, where I contributed to cutting-edge technology projects. My academic journey includes a Research Fellow position at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) School of Computing, within the MapleCG group, under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Bryan Low. I earned my Ph.D. from NUS in 2022, under Prof. Low's mentorship, following a B.Sc in Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science & Technology, China, in 2017.

<span style="color: Blue">*Openings*: Our principled AI research group ($\pi$-Group), specializing in AI learning and optimization theories, seeks researchers and engineers to explore core AI theories, develop sophisticated optimization algorithms, and create practical, robust AI solutions. Interested candidates should contact directly at shuyao@gml.ac.cn.</span>

### Research Interest
Currently, my research interests include but are not restricted to the following aspects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning:
  - Deep Learning Theory, e.g., Neural Tangent Kernel, Statistical Learning Theory.
  - Optimization & Decision-Making, e.g., Zeroth-Order Optimization, Bayesian Optimization, Bandit Algorithm, Reinforcement Learning.
  - Generative Models, e.g., Large Language Model, Diffusion Model.
  - Data-Centric AI, e.g., Data Optimization, Data Valuation, Data Ownership.
  - Automated Machine Learning, e.g., Automated Data Optimization, Neural Architecture Search, Hyper-parameter Optimization.
