## About Me
I am currently a researcher at the Guangdong Lab of AI and Digital Economy (SZ), focusing on pioneering advancements in principled artificial intelligence research. Previously, I was a senior researcher at Tencent, where I contributed to cutting-edge technology projects. My academic journey includes a Research Fellow position at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) School of Computing, within the MapleCG group, under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Bryan Low. I earned my Ph.D. from NUS in 2022, under Prof. Low's mentorship, following a B.Sc in Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science & Technology, China, in 2017.
