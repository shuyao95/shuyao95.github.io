## About Me
I am now a researcher at Tencent. Prior to this, I held the esteemed position of a Research Fellow within the MapleCG group, situated within the School of Computing (SoC) at the distinguished National University of Singapore (NUS), where I had the privilege of being under the mentorship of Prof. Bryan Low. Preceding this tenure, I successfully completed my Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2022, diligently guided by Prof. Bryan Low. Furthermore, my academic journey commenced with the acquisition of a B.Sc degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from Huazhong University of Science & Technology, China, in the year 2017.


### Research Topics
Currently, my research interests include but are not restricted to the following aspects of Machine Learning and Deep Learning:
  - Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), e.g., Automated Data Optimization, Neural Architecture Search, Hyper-parameter Optimization.
  - Deep Learning theory, e.g., Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), Statistical Learning Theory.
  - Optimization algorithms, e.g., Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), Hybrid Optimization, Learn to Optimize (L2O), Bayesian Optimization (BO), Bandit Algorithms.
  - Data-Centric AI, e.g., Data Optimization, Data Valuation, Data Ownership.
